  change_rationale: "Increased timeout from 5.0s to 10.0s and retry count from 3 to 5 to handle OneTrust dynamic loading delays. Added fallback selectors for different consent button states: .onetrust-accept-btn-handler, #accept-recommended-btn-handler, and generic button selectors within OT containers. Added XPath fallbacks for class-based and text-based matching to handle various consent dialog implementations."
