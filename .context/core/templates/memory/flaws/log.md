# Flaws Log (append-only — flows to the protocol package)

Friction caused by the `.context/` system or the protocol itself. See
`README.md` in this directory for the split between `flaws/` and
`inefficiencies/`.

Append-only, but prunable to cold storage: once an entry is explicitly
marked `RESOLVED` / `superseded` / fixed, move it **verbatim** into
`archive.md` in this directory so startup reads only the live entries.
`context-mem prune` reports which entries are archive-eligible (`--list`
names them); age alone never makes an entry eligible — an unresolved flaw
stays here as a live trap.

<!-- TEMPLATE — copy below the last entry:
---
## YYYY-MM-DD — <agent> / <model> (Session N)

- **Flaw:** <what in the protocol or .context/ system didn't work>
- **Symptom:** <what happened to the agent — the observable friction>
- **Root cause:** <why the protocol/.context/ let this happen>
- **Suggested fix:** <concrete change to the package — a step, a pitfall,
  a template, a rule>
- **Status:** open | fixed in package <commit-sha or date>
