## What is Scrapamoja?

Scrapamoja blends the English word *Scrape* with the Swahili word *Pamoja* — meaning *together*. Scrape together. One scraper, many sites. One framework, many contributors.

It's also a quiet nod to *Moja*, Swahili for *one* — the idea that you shouldn't need a different tool for every site you want to scrape. One framework should be enough, and it should be good enough that anyone can extend it.

That philosophy shapes everything about how Scrapamoja is built. It's not a scraper — it's the infrastructure that makes scrapers reliable: handling anti-bot measures, selector drift, network failures, and browser resource leaks so you don't have to. New sites can be added by anyone, existing ones improved by the community, and the whole thing grows stronger the more people contribute to it.

*Scrape together. Build together.*

## Core Framework Capabilities

### 🎯 Intelligent Selector Engine
The selector engine is the heart of Scrapamoja. Instead of brittle single-selector lookups, it uses a **multi-strategy approach** — CSS, XPath, and text-based selectors can all be defined for the same element. Each strategy is weighted, and the engine picks the best match with a confidence score. When a selector fails, it falls back gracefully rather than crashing. Selectors are defined in YAML, not hardcoded, making them easy to maintain without touching Python.

```
Site → Sport → Status → Context → Element
```

### 🛡️ Resilience System
Built around the assumption that things will go wrong. Automatic retries with exponential backoff, failure classification (network vs. selector vs. parse errors), checkpoint-based recovery so long scrapes can resume, and a coordinator that ensures graceful shutdown even mid-scrape.

### 🕵️ Stealth & Anti-Detection
A dedicated stealth module handles fingerprint randomization, human-like behavior simulation, consent popup handling, and proxy rotation. Sites that actively fight scrapers are manageable targets.

### 🔍 Snapshot Debugging
When a scrape fails, Scrapamoja captures a full snapshot: the page HTML, a screenshot, structured logs, and selector resolution traces — all correlated by session ID. Debugging a failure means looking at exactly what the browser saw, not guessing.

### 📊 Telemetry & Observability
Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs, built-in metrics collection (execution time, success rates, selector confidence distributions), and alerting hooks. Production scrapers need production-grade monitoring.

### 🌐 Browser Lifecycle Management
Browser and page pooling, session state persistence, tab management, resource monitoring (memory, CPU), and corruption detection. Long-running scrapers won't leak memory or leave orphaned browser processes.

## Building a New Scraper

Scrapamoja ships with a full site template at `src/sites/_template/` — it's not a stub, it's a working skeleton with flows, processors, validators, config management, and component wiring already in place.

**1. Copy the template**
```bash
cp -r src/sites/_template src/sites/mysite
```

**2. Implement the scraper**
```python
from src.sites.base.site_scraper import BaseSiteScraper

class MySiteScraper(BaseSiteScraper):
    site_id = "mysite"
    site_name = "My Site"
    base_url = "https://example.com"
```

**3. Define selectors in YAML**
```yaml
# src/sites/mysite/selectors/extraction/listings.yaml
description: "Product listing items"
strategies:
  - type: "css"
    selector: ".product-card"
    weight: 1.0
  - type: "xpath"
    selector: "//div[@data-type='product']"
    weight: 0.8
```

**4. Register and run**
```python
# Add to SITE_CLIS in src/main.py
'mysite': ('src.sites.mysite.cli.main', 'MySiteCLI'),
```

---

## Supported Sites

| Site | Data | Sports/Topics | Status Types |
|------|------|---------------|--------------|
| [**FlashScore**](src/sites/flashscore/README.md) | Live scores, match stats, odds | Basketball, Football | Live, Finished, Scheduled |
| [**Wikipedia**](src/sites/wikipedia/README.md) | Article content, tables, references | Any | N/A |

Both are production implementations — the FlashScore scraper handles live match updates, status-aware extraction, and real-time polling. The Wikipedia scraper handles table parsing, multi-language articles, and reference extraction.

---
