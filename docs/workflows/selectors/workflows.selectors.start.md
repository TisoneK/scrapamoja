# Selectors Workflows

This directory contains standardized workflows for selector development, debugging, and maintenance.

## 🎯 Entry Point

**Start here for selector-specific workflows:**

- **[workflows.selectors.debug.md](workflows.selectors.debug.md)** - Quick selector debugging
- **[workflows.selectors.debug.complete.md](workflows.selectors.debug.complete.md)** - Comprehensive debugging methodology
- **[workflows.selectors.design.standards.md](workflows.selectors.design.standards.md)** - Engineering-grade design standards

## Usage

These workflows focus on selector-specific operations:

- Failure analysis and resolution
- DOM structure examination  
- Selector strategy optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Standards compliance

## Integration

Selector workflows integrate with snapshot observability system to provide:
- Evidence-based selector updates
- Historical failure pattern analysis
- Performance tracking for individual selectors
- Systematic debugging procedures

For general system workflows, see parent [workflows.start.md](workflows.start.md).
