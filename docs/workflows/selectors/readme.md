# Selectors Workflows

This directory contains workflows specifically for selector development, debugging, and maintenance.

## Available Workflows

- **[debugging.md](debugging.md)** - Debug selector failures using snapshot observability
- **[complete-debugging-workflow.md](complete-debugging-workflow.md)** - Complete comprehensive debugging methodology
- **[design-standards.md](design-standards.md)** - Define selector design standards and anti-patterns

## Usage

These workflows focus on selector-specific operations:

- Failure analysis and resolution
- DOM structure examination  
- Selector strategy optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Standards compliance

## Integration

Selector workflows integrate with the snapshot observability system to provide:
- Evidence-based selector updates
- Historical failure pattern analysis
- Performance tracking for individual selectors
- Systematic debugging procedures

For general system workflows, see the parent [../readme.md](../readme.md).
