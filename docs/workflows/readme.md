# Scrapamoja Workflows

This directory contains standardized workflows for system operations and debugging.

## Start Here

**New contributors should start here:**

1. **Selector Debugging** → `selectors/debugging.md`
2. **Complete Debugging** → `selectors/complete-debugging-workflow.md`
3. **Snapshot Analysis** → `snapshot-analysis.md`  
4. **System Maintenance** → `system-maintenance.md`

## Available Workflows

- **[selectors/](selectors/)** - Selector-specific workflows
  - **[debugging.md](selectors/debugging.md)** - Debug selector failures using snapshot observability
  - **[complete-debugging-workflow.md](selectors/complete-debugging-workflow.md)** - Complete comprehensive debugging methodology
  - **[design-standards.md](selectors/design-standards.md)** - Define selector design standards and anti-patterns
- **[snapshot-analysis.md](snapshot-analysis.md)** - Analyze snapshot artifacts and system health
- **[system-maintenance.md](system-maintenance.md)** - System maintenance and cleanup procedures

## Usage

Workflows are designed to be executed via CLI commands or manually followed step-by-step.

Each workflow includes:
- Clear purpose and objectives
- Step-by-step procedures
- Expected outcomes
- Quick reference commands

## Integration

These workflows integrate with the snapshot observability system to provide:
- Evidence-based debugging
- Standardized processes
- Reproducible results
- Historical analysis capabilities

For more information, see the main [Snapshot System Status](../SNAPSHOT_SYSTEM_STATUS.md) documentation.
